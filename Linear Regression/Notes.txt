Probability for class true and class false
logistic regression = based on x (independent values) what is the result of y (in 1 or 0)

Linear regression cannot capture the nature of binary results

Why is the proportion of the of the Churn important?
Because you want to maintain the same proportion in your model's output. To avoid making machine's that are biased.

Why not split model to see pattern of churn true and another model to check what factors result to churn false?


We only scale the train set because in theory, the model should have never seen the test values. The transform applies to both because once the scaler has been finalized, you have to apply it to the test set.

Any transformations on your train set must be done on the test set.

Naive Bayes:
Likelihood is the rate of occurrence based on past events while probability is the chance of it showing in future events

Min max scaler = for cat and num
Standard scaler = for num

Standard scaler - standardize features by removing the mean and scaling to unit variance. 1 standard dev away and mean is 0. Leave out categorical values (answered as 1 and 0) and add them after scaling. For ordinal, use minmaxscaler.

*What is a pipieline?
*study up on regularization
*study up on F1 score

If comparing against models, use odd number of cv.
If it's just measuring validity, you can use even number
5 is good for 10,000+ values
10 is good for 100,000+ values

*study K-S Statistic

AUC - ROC
Curve between true positive rate against your false positive rate.
